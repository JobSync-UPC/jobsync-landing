        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl text-secondary mb-4">APPLYING FOR A JOB FROM JOBSYNC</h2>
        <p>For participating in processes on our web service, we will ask you to provide us with your personal data for:</p>
        <ol class="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Facilitate the complete process procedure.</li>
          <li>Create statements, notes and planning related to the process.</li>
          <li>Maintain communications via mail or telephone with you about the application, if applicable. We process your personal data based on our legitimate interests for recruitment purposes. We are obliged to inform you that the retention of personal data in your job application may provide you with a disadvantage compared to other applicants for the same position.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In processing your personal data, we have balanced our legitimate interests against your fundamental rights and freedoms. Where necessary, we have taken appropriate measures to limit the implications and avoid unwarranted harm to you. For example, (i) we will only use your personal data for the specific purposes mentioned and (ii) we will only request/use personal data that we absolutely need for the application process.</p>
        <p>JOBSYNC reserves the right to analyze candidate data according to our legitimate interest. Depending on the process, candidates may be contacted by companies interested in their profile.</p>
        <p>JOBSYNC is in no way involved in the recruitment and selection processes administered on its platform. Thus, JOBSYNC has no control over the conduct of JOBSYNC and APPLICANTS and is not a party to any agreements entered into between JOBSYNC and APPLICANTS and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, assumes no liability in this regard.</p>
        <p>JOBSYNC assessment results are valid for 12 months. During this period of time, candidates do not have the right to retake the assessments. During this period of time (12 months), these results will be validated in the event that candidates apply for another position and/or another company requests these same assessments as part of their selection process.</p>

      <article class="flex flex-col gap-4">
        <h2 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl text-secondary mb-4">DELETION OF INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>The candidate has the right to delete his/her JOBSYNC account and associated data and results. However, the candidate cannot (i) apply for a selection process through JOBSYNC, (ii) create a new session, (iii) retake the assessments, until a period of 12 months has elapsed.</p>
        <p>You may request deletion of your personal information by emailing us at support@jobsync.com with the information necessary for us to process your request. Any request for deletion of information will be subject to our Retention Policy described below. A note about our games: because some of our games are designed to assess instinctive behavior, which may be biased if the games are played more than once, once a candidate begins or completes the games, the Game Data and Trait Profile cannot be restored, modified, deleted or voided for a period of 12 months after completing the games.</p>

Where we do not have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in back-up files), we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until such time as it is possible to delete it.</p>
